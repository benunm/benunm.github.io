I'd like to make music that deviates from a contemporary patter of minimalist and mellow music. I don't want to abandon minimalism in favor of maximalism, whatever that is, but I'd like to capitalize on excess.
There have been so many artists that created music in The Velvet Underground vein, but all too often they miss the mark, or at least miss my mark. The punks lack poetics, the uniformly-mellow indie bands lack the Bacchanalian excitement, the Shoegazers are too stoned for their own good.
